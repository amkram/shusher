## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[ShUShER Code of Conduct](https://github.com/amkram/shusherblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [alex.kramer@ucsc.edu](mailto:alex.kramer@ucsc.edu).


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/amkram/shusher/blob/master/README.md).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/amkram/shusherissues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/amkram/shusher/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, browser, etc.), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then review the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

**If you are having issues with the web tool:**
- Please include in your bug report:
  - The browser and version you are using
  - If relevant, provide a copy of the FASTA or VCF file you are providing to ShUShER (only for samples that do not contain PHI). Otherwise, provide as much detail about the format and contents as you are able.
  - What went wrong? Include any errors or status messages you can see.
  - There may be additional information in the developer console. [Open the console](https://balsamiq.com/support/faqs/browserconsole/#mozilla-firefox) and copy the output into your bug report.

**If you are having issues running ShUShER locally:**
- Please include in your bug report:
  - OS, Platform and Version
  - Version of npm, Node.js, UShER, etc. depending on what seems relevant.
  - Modifications, if any, you have made to the source code.
  - Relevant errors and information messages.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [alex.kramer@ucsc.edu](mailto:alex.kramer@ucsc.edu).
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/amkram/shusher/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to label the issue as a bug yet.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- We will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for ShUShER, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/amkram/shusher/README.md) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/amkram/shusher/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. Good enhancement suggestions are useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/amkram/shusher/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most ShUShER users. You may also want to point out other projects that solved it better which could serve as inspiration.
