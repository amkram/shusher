##### Column: sequence view


Each row displays a schema of the corresponding sequence by highlighting the differences to the reference Wuhan-Hu-1 along the genome.

Positions are 1-based.

Line markers on sequence views represent mutations colored by the resulting nucleotide:

Unsequenced regions at the 5' and 3' end are indicated as light gray shading.
For a mapping between positions in the sequence, genes and clade-defining mutations, see Genome Annotation view below the table.
Note that sometimes mutations are so close to each other that they overlap.
